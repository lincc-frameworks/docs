The LINCC-Frameworks team is composed of research scientists, software engineers, and faculty across multiple institutions as well as leadership from LSSTC working at the intersection of state of the art computer science and cutting edge astrophysics. The team's mission is to design and build algorithms, libraries, and analysis frameworks, to support science for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For more information on the LINCC-Frameworks team see the [LINCC-frameworks page](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/lincc/frameworks).
