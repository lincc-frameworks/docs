# LINCC Tech Talks

## A FORUM TO CONNECT THE RUBIN SOFTWARE COMMUNITY

Delivered virtually every second Thursday of the month at 10am Pacific (1pm ET, 2pm Chile, 7pm CET) these talks and demos will showcase work done by the broad Rubin software and archives community thatâ€™s designed to enable LSST science. We hope it will provide a forum for a range of groups and authors to present, learn about, and discuss efforts of interest to analysis of LSST data.

### CONNECTING

The talks are delivered via Zoom at https://ls.st/lincc-talks. The recordings will be made publicly available generally within a week of the talk.
